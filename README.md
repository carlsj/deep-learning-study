# Deep-learning-study
A data and source code for studying deep-leanring
* This study is based on a book [『밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝』](http://www.hanbit.co.kr/store/books/look.php?p_code=B8475831198) (ゼロから作る Deep Learning).
* Most of the code were re-writed in my own terms with modifications of code based on [This](https://github.com/WegraLee/deep-learning-from-scratch) repository.

## Requirement
The code require following softwares to be excuted
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

or

* Anaconda 4.2.x or 4.3.x : [Download](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/)
  * This package includes all the softwares above
  * Recommend to use 4.2.x which includes Python 3.5 to use [google tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) later
